# msgpack-cxx PyPI

This repo contains automation for [msgpack-cxx](https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack-c/tree/cpp_master).

It creates, packages and pushes the header-only library to PyPI.
This repo is the equivalent of the [Anaconda msgpack-cxx](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/msgpack-cxx) package.

**NOTE:** Packages created by this repo only contain the raw source code and not the Python package.
The Python package can be found in [msgpack](https://pypi.org/project/msgpack/).

Credits go to the maintainers of the [msgpack-cxx](https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack-c/tree/cpp_master) package.

## License

The files in this repository are licensed under the Boost Software License - Version 1.0.

The distributed msgpack-cxx package is a redistribution of [msgpack-cxx](https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack-c/tree/cpp_master) and therefore falls under the [msgpack-cxx license model](https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack-c/blob/cpp_master/COPYING) as described in the [COPYING file in the msgpack-cxx](https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack-c/blob/cpp_master/COPYING).
Since all distributed files are obtained by download in the automation, instead of being explicitly included into this library,
the [msgpack-cxx license](https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack-c/blob/cpp_master/COPYING) is not provided explicitly as a file in this repository either.
