# msgpack-cxx PyPI

This repo contains automation for [msgpack-cxx](https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack-c/tree/cpp_master).

It creates, packages and pushes the header-only library to PyPI.
This repo is the equivalent of the [Anaconda msgpack-cxx](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/msgpack-cxx) package.

**NOTE:** Packages created by this repo only contain the raw source code and not the Python package.
The Python package can be found in [msgpack](https://pypi.org/project/msgpack/).

Credits go to the maintainers of the [msgpack-cxx](https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack-c/tree/cpp_master) package.
